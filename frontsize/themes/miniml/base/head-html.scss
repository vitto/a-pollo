// Represents a span of text in an alternate voice or mood,
// or otherwise offset from the normal prose, such as a taxonomic designation,
// a technical term, an idiomatic phrase from another language, a thought,
// a ship name, or some other prose whose typical typographic presentation is italicized.
//
// Only use i when nothing more suitable is available
// â€” e.g., em for text with stress emphasis, strong for text with semantic importance,
// cite for titles in a citation or bibliography, dfn for defining a word,
// and var for mathematical variables.
