// When the meter binding applies to a meter element,
// the element is expected to render as an 'inline-block' box
// with a 'height' of '1em' and a 'width' of '5em',
// a 'vertical-align' of '-0.2em', and with its contents depicting a gauge.
//
// When the element is wider than it is tall(or square),
// the depiction is expected to be of a horizontal gauge,
// with the minimum value on the right if the 'direction' property
// on this element has a computed value of 'rtl', and on the left otherwise.
//
// When the element is taller than it is wide, it is expected to depict
// a vertical gauge, with the minimum value on the bottom.
