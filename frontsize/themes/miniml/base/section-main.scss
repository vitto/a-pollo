// The main element is an exact analogue of ARIA's role="main",
// and is designed to show screenreaders and assistive technologies
// exactly where main content begins, so it can be a target
// for a "skip links" keyboard command, for example.
//
// It could also be used for content syndication (Instapaper-ish things);
// mobile browsers could zoom in on main when encountering non-responsive
// websites.
//
// It should therefore be used once per page.
//
// If you use something like <div id="main"> (or similar, such as
// <div id="content">), simply replace that with <main role="main">.
