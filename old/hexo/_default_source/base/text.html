    This is the <b>text</b> page example
</p>

<br>

<h6>A</h6>

<div class="apollo-row apollo-row--gain apollo-row--2-columns">
<div>
<p>
    If the a element has an href attribute, then it represents a hyperlink (a hypertext anchor). If the a element has no href attribute, then the element represents a placeholder for where a link might otherwise have been placed, if it had been relevant.
</p>
<p>
    The target, rel, media, hreflang, and type attributes must be omitted if the href attribute is not present.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
    <a href="http://vit.to">Vittorio Vittori</a>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<br>

<h6>ABBR</h6>

<div class="apollo-row apollo-row--gain apollo-row--2-columns">
<div>
<p>
    Represents an abbreviation or acronym. The optional title attribute may be used to provide an expansion of the abbreviation. If specified, the title attribute must contain an expansion of the abbreviation and nothing else.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
    The <abbr title="Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group">WHATWG</abbr> started working on HTML5 in 2004.

<h6>ADDRESS</h6>

<div class="apollo-row apollo-row--gain apollo-row--2-columns">
<div>
<p>
    Represents the contact information for its enclosing section. If it is a child of the body element, then it applies to the document as a whole.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
    <address>James Bond</address>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<br>

<h6>B</h6>

<div class="apollo-row apollo-row--gain apollo-row--2-columns">
<div>
<p>
    Represents a span of text to be stylistically offset from the normal prose without conveying any extra importance. Examples are key words in a document abstract, product names in a review, or other spans of text whose typical typographic presentation is bold.
</p>
<p>
    The b element should be used as a last resort when no other element is more appropriate. In particular, headings should use the h1 to h6 elements, stress emphasis should use the em element, importance should be denoted with the strong element, and text marked or highlighted should use the mark element.

<br>

<h6>BDI</h6>

<div class="apollo-row apollo-row--gain apollo-row--2-columns">
<div>
<p>
    The bdi element represents a span of text that is to be isolated from its surroundings for the purposes of bidirectional text formatting.
</p>

<ul>
<li><bdi>johnsmith</bdi> joined the site</li>
<li><bdi>the_guru</bdi> posted "February update"</li>
<li><bdi>????</bdi> commented on "Getting started with HTML5"</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<br>

<h6>BDO</h6>

<div class="apollo-row apollo-row--gain apollo-row--2-columns">
<div>
<p>
    The bdo element represents explicit text directionality formatting control for its children. It allows authors to override the Unicode bidirectional algorithm by explicitly specifying a direction override.
</p>
</div>

    <bdo dir="rtl">Don't cheat by reading this in a mirror!</bdo>

<br>

<h6>BLOCKQUOTE</h6>

<div class="apollo-row apollo-row--gain apollo-row--2-columns">
<div>
<p>
    The blockquote element represents a section that is quoted from another source.
</p>
<p>
    Content inside a blockquote must be quoted from another source, whose address, if it has one, may be cited in the cite attribute.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
    <blockquote>What we have here is a quotation from another source</blockquote>
</p>
</div>
</div>


<br>

<h6>CITE</h6>

<div class="apollo-row apollo-row--gain apollo-row--2-columns">
<div>
<p>
    The cite element represents the title of a work (e.g. a book, a paper, an essay, a poem, a score, a song, a script, a film, a TV show, a game, a sculpture, a painting, a theatre production, a play, an opera, a musical, an exhibition, a legal case report, etc). This can be a work that is being quoted or referenced in detail (i.e. a citation), or it can just be a work that is mentioned in passing.
</p>
<p>
    A person's name is not the title of a work — even if people call that person a piece of work — and the element must therefore not be used to mark up people's names. (In some cases, the b element might be appropriate for names; e.g. in a gossip article where the names of famous people are keywords rendered with a different style to draw attention to them. In other cases, if an element is really needed, the span element can be used.)

<h6>CODE</h6>

<div class="apollo-row apollo-row--gain apollo-row--2-columns">
<div>
<p>
    The code element represents a fragment of computer code. This could be an XML element name, a filename, a computer program, or any other string that a computer would recognize.
