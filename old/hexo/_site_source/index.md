### How it works?

You write code doc blocks in your CSS widgets:

```
/*@pollo
    @name:  Twitter
    @auth:  Vittorio Vittori
    @category: Buttons
    @date:  2015-12-02
    @text:  This twitter version has also `button-social--with-effects` modifier to show drop shadow effects
    @html:  <a href="#" class="button-social button-social--twitter button-social--with-effects">
                <div class="button-social__icon">
                    <i class="fa fa-twitter"></i>
                </div>
                <div class="button-social__network">
                    twitter
                </div>
            </a>
*/
```

You generate your style guide with this node command

```
./node_modules/.bin/a-pollo
```

That's it.
